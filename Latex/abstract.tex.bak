\chapter*{Abstract}

\par{
The following work is a reproduction of the steps used to build a fully functional web service in a eHealth environment as a web of things. The final product is composed of two parts: a client and a server application.}
\par{The server is used to store and manipulate data that caregiver in a medical facility have to work with on a daily basis. It is designed towards accessibility and openness and allows access by any internet capable device, providing that the user is authenticated. }
\par{The client on the other hand is designed to facilitate daily work by presenting the stored data in a practical manner. Adding, modifying and removing data must be as intuitive as possible. }
